# mdice 0.1
A basic python script designed to replicate the full functionality of a set of dice for tabletop roleplaying games.
Takes commands, alternate between dice choice, rerolls, etc.

Currently functional: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 & D20 rolls.

Update log:
* D100 & 1000 added

Updates TK: 
* multipliers functionality ("D00") 
* critical hit & miss notation on D20 
* multi-dice or roll selection

More to come when I get around to it.
